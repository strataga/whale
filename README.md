# Whale

Whale is an open-source, AI-first project planner and organizer that integrates with OpenClaw. It should work for any domain (product, marketing, ops, personal projects) and “just work” by adapting its workflow based on what the user tells the AI.

## Vision
- **Dynamic agent interface**: UI adapts to user intent and project type.
- **Zero setup**: ask a few questions, generate a plan, and keep it updated.
- **OpenClaw-native**: can call OpenClaw tools/agents for research, drafting, and execution.

## Core User Flow (v0)
1. User describes goal in plain language.
2. Whale generates: scope, milestones, tasks, and daily plan.
3. User approves/edits. Whale schedules check-ins and keeps tasks fresh.
4. Whale can delegate work to OpenClaw (research, drafts, etc.).

## Principles
- Universal: usable for any type of project.
- Minimal friction: no heavy configuration.
- Traceable: clear decisions, progress, and next actions.

## Next Steps
See `docs/plan.md`.
